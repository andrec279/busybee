Code is now live at: https://busybee-264219.appspot.com/

<b>Introduction:</b>
busybee is a personal project I built while teaching myself how to code. My learning goals with this project were:
1. Learn to build a full-stack web application using Flask framework
2. Build a useful tool to solve an everyday problem for myself
3. Build an interactive user interface that tracks and stores user interaction data
4. Create basic JS-based data visualizations to display user data

<b>How it works:</b>
Note: This web application is best viewed with some user data already inputted. To view a more "complete" profile for a test account I created, log into the web application with the following credentials:

<b>username:</b> test1
<b>password:</b> test

busybee allows users to organize their lives into categories: school, work, hobbies, etc.
They can then create goals within those categories and subtasks in checklist format.
As they create goals and complete tasks, their usage data is stored and reflected in a basic dashboard on the homepage, which shows:
1. Tasks completed vs. incomplete
2. Breakdown of categories by number of goals in each, with the option to drill down into a given category
3. Tasks completed over time, offering a basic measure of user consistency
